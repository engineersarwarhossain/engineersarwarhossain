- 👋 Hi, I’m Md.Sarwar Hossain
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded systems, microcontrollers, IoT, firmware development, and contributing to open-source hardware libraries (especially around ESP32).
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into I²C timing nuances, experimenting with BLE mesh on ESP32s, and optimizing power profiles for battery-powered IoT sensors I²C communication protocols, ESP32 application development, and low-power wireless networking.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on end-to-end IoT systems—from PCB prototyping and sensor integration to cloud dashboards and mobile apps—for applications like smart agriculture and environmental monitoring

- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a handheld game console on a custom ESP32 PCB with an OLED that runs retro games at 60 FPS—and it still holds an 8-hour charge!
